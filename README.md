# Rust-timetable-calendar
This is a Rust-powered calendar app designed to help users effortlessly plan, organize, and schedule their daily activities.
It is a simple, fast, and efficient Rust-powered timetable/calendar app that helps users plan their day, schedule activities, and stay organized.

This project was built to demonstrate how Rust can be used to create lightweight command-line tools that handle user input, scheduling, and time-management tasks with reliability and speed.

# Features

## Create and manage daily activities

## Add tasks with specific times

## View your full timetable in a clean layout

## Edit or update existing activities

❌ Delete tasks you no longer need

⚡ Fast, efficient, and memory-safe (thanks to Rust!)

🛠 Technologies Used

Rust (stable toolchain)

Cargo for building and running the project

Standard Library for user input and time management

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jennaose/Rust-timetable-calendar.git

3. Run the application
cargo run

📘 How It Works

The calendar lets you:

Enter an activity

Choose the time you want to schedule it

View your entire timetable in a neat format

Update or remove tasks anytime

The goal is to make a simple but functional scheduling tool while practicing Rust fundamentals like:

Ownership & borrowing

Structs

Error handling

User input handling

Modular code

📌 Future Improvements
